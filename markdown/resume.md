governing the development, use, and administration of core infrastructure, and IT
management platforms.

Technical Experience
--------------------

**Programming Languages**

:   **GoLang:** My goto language for plumbing backends, with GRPC services, and async consumers.

:   **Python:** Training ML models, building inference pipelines, utility scripting, and avoiding async whenever possible.

**Cloud Eng**

: **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes expert with comprehensive experience spanning high-level operations to low-level architecture. Proficient in developing operators and custom resource definitions. 

: **Infrastructure as Code:** Proficient in deploying resources across all major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Terraform and Pulumi. Demonstrated expertise in leveraging IaC for efficient and consistent cloud infrastructure management.

: **Persistance on K8s:** I have experience hosting a number of persistance systems on k8s: Kafka, Redis, MinIO and NFS servers.

**Development Essentials**

: **Scripting:** Shell, Bash, PowerShell
: **Message Brokers:** Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka
: **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Octopus
: **Containerization:** Docker
: **Plumbing** GRPC, REST, protos

**Side Project**
:   **Collaboration tool for Digital Audio Workstations:** Music producers often face limited collaboration opportunities within leading Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Ableton and FL Studio. Since 2005, Git has revolutionized the way software developers collaborate and manage source control. Inspired by this, my aim is to harness the power of Git and source control to revolutionize collaboration for music producers, opening up new avenues for creative synergy and efficiency in music production.
