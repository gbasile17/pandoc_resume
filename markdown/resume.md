Sep'19 - Jan'24
:   **Senior Software Engineer (Infrastructure):** **GoPuff**

As the 30th technical hire and the inaugural infrastructure engineer at a fast-paced, rapidly growing startup, I had the privilege of transforming a nascent cloud infrastructure into a best-in-class development platform. My role was pivotal in evolving the cloud's initial chaos into a sophisticated and efficient system, setting a high standard for future developments. Notable achievements include:

* Defined best practices for deploying Azure, GCP, and AWS PAAS Infrasture via Infrastructure as Code

* Architected and implemented networks, messaging bus, and database infrastructure
for a high traffic volume last mile logistics system with elements spread across three
clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP).

* Pioneered GoPuff's Kubernetes (AKS) strategy and successfully deployed the first
Kubernetes cluster at GoPuff, leading to organization-wide adoption of
containerization and Kubernetes-based infrastructure.

Jan'19 - Aug'19
:   **Senior DevOps Consultant:** **Bankmobile Inc.**

Consulted on the transformation of a monolithic mobile banking backend into a
white-label SaaS product with a focus on a repeatable, scalable infrastructure and
simple form-based deployment pipelines.

Sep'16 - Dec'18
:   **Technical Operations Engineer:** **AlphaPoint Inc.**

At this cryptocurrency technology startup, I developed and maintained automated CI/CD pipelines for a stack serving over 100 exchange clients, enhancing deployment speed, and reliability. My collaboration with sales teams aligned operational strategies with customer needs, boosting satisfaction and retention. Additionally, I managed the secure integration and maintenance of diverse cryptocurrency nodes and wallets.

**Side Project**
:   **Collaboration tool for Digital Audio Workstations:** Music producers often face limited collaboration opportunities within leading Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Ableton and FL Studio. Since 2005, Git has revolutionized the way software developers collaborate and manage source control. Inspired by this, my aim is to harness the power of Git and source control to revolutionize collaboration for music producers, opening up new avenues for creative synergy and efficiency in music production.
