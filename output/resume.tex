\startdescription{April'24 - Present}
  {\bf Member of Technical Staff:} {\bf Udio}
\stopdescription

As a key member of the founding engineering team at Udio, I spearheaded
the development of a cutting-edge generative audio platform on Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE), leveraging Google's TPU compute platform for
advanced model training and inference. I played a pivotal role in
defining MLOps processes within a nascent and rapidly evolving domain,
architecting robust, high-throughput inference systems designed for
scalable performance.

\startdescription{Sep'19 - Jan'24}
  {\bf Senior Software Engineer (Infrastructure):} {\bf GoPuff}
\stopdescription

Transformed a nascent cloud environment into a robust development
platform, setting a high standard for future scalability. Key
achievements include: • Defined best practices for deploying Azure, GCP,
and AWS PaaS via Infrastructure as Code. • Architected networks,
messaging buses, and databases for a high-traffic, multi-cloud logistics
system. • Led GoPuff's Kubernetes (AKS) strategy, deploying the first
cluster and driving organization-wide adoption.

\startdescription{Jan'19 - Aug'19}
  {\bf Senior DevOps Consultant:} {\bf Bankmobile Inc.}
\stopdescription

Consulted on the transformation of a monolithic mobile banking backend
into a white-label SaaS product with a focus on a repeatable, scalable
infrastructure and simple form-based deployment pipelines.

\startdescription{Sep'16 - Dec'18}
  {\bf Technical Operations Engineer:} {\bf AlphaPoint Inc.}
\stopdescription

At this cryptocurrency technology startup, I developed and maintained
automated CI/CD pipelines for a stack serving over 100 exchange clients,
enhancing deployment speed, and reliability. My collaboration with sales
teams aligned operational strategies with customer needs, boosting
satisfaction and retention. Additionally, I managed the secure
integration and maintenance of diverse cryptocurrency nodes and wallets.

\startdescription{May'12 - Sep'16}
  {\bf Director of Information Technology:} {\bf Automall 46 Inc.}
\stopdescription

Established, implemented, and maintained best practices and operational
procedures governing the development, use, and administration of core
infrastructure, and IT management platforms.

\subsection[title={Technical
Experience},reference={technical-experience}]

\startdescription{{\bf Programming Languages}}
  {\bf GoLang:} My goto language for plumbing backends, with GRPC
  services, and async consumers.

  {\bf Python:} Training ML models, building inference pipelines,
  utility scripting, and avoiding async whenever possible.
\stopdescription

\startdescription{{\bf Cloud Eng}}
  {\bf Kubernetes:} Kubernetes expert with comprehensive experience
  spanning high-level operations to low-level architecture. Proficient
  in developing operators and custom resource definitions.

  {\bf Infrastructure as Code:} Proficient in deploying resources across
  all major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Terraform and
  Pulumi. Demonstrated expertise in leveraging IaC for efficient and
  consistent cloud infrastructure management.

  {\bf Persistance on K8s:} I have experience hosting a number of
  persistance systems on k8s: Kafka, Redis, MinIO and NFS servers.
\stopdescription

\startdescription{{\bf Development Essentials}}
  {\bf Scripting:} Shell, Bash, PowerShell

  {\bf Message Brokers:} Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka

  {\bf CI/CD:} GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Octopus

  {\bf Containerization:} Docker

  {\bf Plumbing} GRPC, REST, protos
\stopdescription

\startdescription{{\bf Side Project}}
  {\bf Collaboration tool for Digital Audio Workstations:} Music
  producers often face limited collaboration opportunities within
  leading Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Ableton and FL Studio.
  Since 2005, Git has revolutionized the way software developers
  collaborate and manage source control. Inspired by this, my aim is to
  harness the power of Git and source control to revolutionize
  collaboration for music producers, opening up new avenues for creative
  synergy and efficiency in music production.
