  {\bf Senior Software Engineer (Infrastructure):} {\bf GoPuff}
\stopdescription

As the 30th technical hire and the inaugural infrastructure engineer at
a fast-paced, rapidly growing startup, I had the privilege of
transforming a nascent cloud infrastructure into a best-in-class
development platform. My role was pivotal in evolving the cloud's
initial chaos into a sophisticated and efficient system, setting a high
standard for future developments. Notable achievements include:

\startitemize
\item
  Defined best practices for deploying Azure, GCP, and AWS PAAS
  Infrasture via Infrastructure as Code
\item
  Architected and implemented networks, messaging bus, and database
  infrastructure for a high traffic volume last mile logistics system
  with elements spread across three clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP).
\item
  Pioneered GoPuff's Kubernetes (AKS) strategy and successfully deployed
  the first Kubernetes cluster at GoPuff, leading to organization-wide
  adoption of containerization and Kubernetes-based infrastructure.
